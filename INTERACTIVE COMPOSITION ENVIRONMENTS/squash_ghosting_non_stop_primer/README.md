## Running it locally
Clone this repo, start your favourite local dev server and navigate to the `index.html`
in your browser.

If you don't have a web server (like `http-server`) to run locally
(or don't know what this means), then you can install this project's dev dependencies
and run the `start` command:

```
git clone https://github.com/magenta/listen-to-transformer
cd listen-to-transformer
npm install
npm start  # Then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your browser.
```
