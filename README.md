**Squash ghosting sonification Datasets**

Models tracked from Simon Kilshaw foot patterns while ghosting the six corners of a squash court. May 2021 at Rhiwbina Squash club.

**Format**

The models are a single averaged microcycle of a ghosting pattern and exist in json. format and as midi grooves. For pull requests use the The API endpoint locally for this project. (No hosting yet, besides it is not a restful API at the moment). Clone or download locally from this repository.

These case studies form part of the research project that seeks to determine "A musical classification of squash specific movement patterns in elite squash players."

Through precise tracking of step combinations, these vignettes explore the rhythmic and expressive attributes of learned  and deliberate foot patterns, observed and heard in squash player practicing or “ghosting” . 

Through signification, these analyses can offer a heightened perception of a player’s pace, rhythm, timing,  flow and phrasing,  ornamentation and stylistic characteristic interpretations of different elite squash players. 

**Soundfiles**

The sonified micro cycles are treated as individual sound objects or themes, from which variations are composed and through-composed.
The computer music compositions make use of the following libraries: ml_lib for puredata,  tone.js, tensorflow and magenta, as well as the Open API muse project.
