 Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after\'a0he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and many\'a0were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover\'a0he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his\'a0men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they\'a0perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god\'a0Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too,\'a0about all these things, O daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you\'a0may know them.\
\
So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got\'a0safely home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to\'a0his wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got\'a0him into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there\'a0came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca; even\'a0then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were not\'a0yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except Neptune,\'a0who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get\'a0home.\
\
Now Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world's\'a0end, and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East. He\'a0had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying\'a0himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of Olympian\'a0Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment he was thinking\'a0of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon's son Orestes; so he said\'a0to the other gods:\
\
"See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all\'a0nothing but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love\'a0to Agamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew\'a0it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do\'a0either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his revenge\'a0when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him this in all\'a0good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for everything in\'a0full."\
\
Then Minerva said, "Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served\'a0Aegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but Aegisthus\'a0is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart bleeds, when\'a0I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island, far away, poor\'a0man, from all his friends. It is an island covered with forest, in the\'a0very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there, daughter of the magician\'a0Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the ocean, and carries the great columns\'a0that keep heaven and earth asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold\'a0of poor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment\'a0to make him forget his home, so that he is tired of life, and thinks of\'a0nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You,\'a0sir, take no heed of this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he\'a0not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep\'a0on being so angry with him?"\
\
And Jove said, "My child, what are you talking about? How can I\'a0forget Ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more\'a0liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear\'a0in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having\'a0blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to\'a0Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys; therefore\'a0though he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by preventing\'a0him from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together and see how\'a0we can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified, for if we are\'a0all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us."\
\
And Minerva said, "Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then,\'a0the gods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send Mercury\'a0to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and\'a0that he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca, to put heart\'a0into Ulysses' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the Achaeans\'a0in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who persist\'a0in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I will also conduct him\'a0to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hear anything about the return\'a0of his dear father- for this will make people speak well of\'a0him."\
\
So saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable,\'a0with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the\'a0redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith\'a0she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her, and down she darted\'a0from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith she was in Ithaca,\'a0at the gateway of Ulysses' house, disguised as a visitor, Mentes, chief\'a0of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in her hand. There she found\'a0the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which they had killed and\'a0eaten, and playing draughts in front of the house. Men-servants and pages\'a0were bustling about to wait upon them, some mixing wine with water in the\'a0mixing-bowls, some cleaning down the tables with wet sponges and laying\'a0them out again, and some cutting up great quantities of\'a0meat.\
\
Telemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting\'a0moodily among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would\'a0send them flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again\'a0and be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them,\'a0he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for he was vexed\'a0that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took her right\'a0hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. "Welcome," said he, "to\'a0our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall tell us what you\'a0have come for."\
\
He led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they\'a0were within he took her spear and set it in the spear- stand against a\'a0strong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father,\'a0and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a\'a0cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet, and he set another\'a0seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she might not be\'a0annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence, and that he might ask\'a0her more freely about his father.\
\
A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer\'a0and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she\'a0drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and\'a0offered them many good things of what there was in the house, the carver\'a0fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their\'a0side, and a man-servant brought them wine and poured it out for\'a0them.\
\
Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and\'a0seats. Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids went\'a0round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and\'a0water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that were before\'a0them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted music\'a0and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet, so a servant\'a0brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled perforce to sing to them.\'a0As soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing Telemachus spoke low to\'a0Minerva, with his head close to hers that no man might\'a0hear.\
\
"I hope, sir," said he, "that you will not be offended with what\'a0I am going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it,\'a0and all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some\'a0wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were to see\'a0my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather than\'a0a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he, alas, has fallen\'a0on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes say that he is coming,\'a0we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now, sir, tell\'a0me and tell me true, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your\'a0town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how your crew brought\'a0you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared themselves to be- for you\'a0cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly, for I want to know, are you\'a0a stranger to this house, or have you been here in my father's time? In\'a0the old days we had many visitors for my father went about much\'a0himself."\
\
And Minerva answered, "I will tell you truly and particularly all\'a0about it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians.\'a0I have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign\'a0tongue being bound for Temesa with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring back\'a0copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country away from\'a0the town, in the harbour Rheithron under the wooded mountain Neritum. Our\'a0fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell you, if you will\'a0go and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes to town now, and\'a0lives by himself in the country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look\'a0after him and get his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from pottering\'a0about his vineyard. They told me your father was at home again, and that\'a0was why I came, but it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for he\'a0is not dead yet not on the mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt\'a0island in mid ocean, or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him\'a0against his will I am no prophet, and know very little about omens, but\'a0I speak as it is borne in upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will\'a0not be away much longer; for he is a man of such resource that even though\'a0he were in chains of iron he would find some means of getting home again.\'a0But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine looking\'a0fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head and\'a0eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where the flower\'a0of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never either of us\'a0seen the other."\
\
"My mother," answered Telemachus, tells me I am son to Ulysses,\'a0but it is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son\'a0to one who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there\'a0is no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my\'a0father."\
\
And Minerva said, "There is no fear of your race dying out yet,\'a0while Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me\'a0true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people?\'a0What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the\'a0family- for no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own? And\'a0the guests- how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make over\'a0the whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person who comes\'a0near them."\
\
"Sir," said Telemachus, "as regards your question, so long as my\'a0father was here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in\'a0their displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more\'a0closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it better\'a0even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before Troy, or\'a0had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done;\'a0for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes, and I should\'a0myself have been heir to his renown; but now the storm-winds have spirited\'a0him away we know not wither; he is gone without leaving so much as a trace\'a0behind him, and I inherit nothing but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply\'a0with grief for the loss of my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of\'a0yet another kind; for the chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same,\'a0and the woodland island of Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of\'a0Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying their\'a0court to my mother, who will neither point blank say that she will not\'a0marry, nor yet bring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my\'a0estate, and before long will do so also with myself."\
\
"Is that so?" exclaimed Minerva, "then you do indeed want Ulysses\'a0home again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and if he\'a0is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making\'a0merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were he\'a0to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming from Ephyra,\'a0where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son of Mermerus.\'a0Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give him any, but my father\'a0let him have some, for he was very fond of him. If Ulysses is the man he\'a0then was these suitors will have a short shrift and a sorry\'a0wedding.\
\
"But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to\'a0return, and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however,\'a0urge you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take\'a0my advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow -lay your case\'a0before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors take\'a0themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother's mind is set\'a0on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will find her a husband\'a0and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a daughter may\'a0expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take the best ship\'a0you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest of your father\'a0who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you something, or (and\'a0people often hear things in this way) some heaven-sent message may direct\'a0you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor; thence go on to Sparta and visit\'a0Menelaus, for he got home last of all the Achaeans; if you hear that your\'a0father is alive and on his way home, you can put up with the waste these\'a0suitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand you\'a0hear of his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with\'a0all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry\'a0again. Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mind how,\'a0by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You\'a0are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heard how people\'a0are singing Orestes' praises for having killed his father's murderer Aegisthus?\'a0You are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make\'a0yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must go back to my ship and to\'a0my crew, who will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think the\'a0matter over for yourself, and remember what I have said to\'a0you."\
\
"Sir," answered Telemachus, "it has been very kind of you to talk\'a0to me in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you\'a0tell me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a\'a0little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will\'a0then give you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I will\'a0give you one of great beauty and value- a keepsake such as only dear friends\'a0give to one another."\
\
Minerva answered, "Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my\'a0way at once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it\'a0till I come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a\'a0very good one, and I will give you one of no less value in\'a0return."\
\
With these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she\'a0had given Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about\'a0his father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the stranger\'a0had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors were\'a0sitting.\
\
Phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence\'a0as he told the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had\'a0laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from\'a0her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not alone, but\'a0attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood\'a0by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloisters with\'a0a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a veil, moreover, before\'a0her face, and was weeping bitterly.\
\
"Phemius," she cried, "you know many another feat of gods and heroes,\'a0such as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, and\'a0let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it breaks\'a0my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I mourn ever\'a0without ceasing, and whose name was great over all Hellas and middle\'a0Argos."\
\
"Mother," answered Telemachus, "let the bard sing what he has a\'a0mind to; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they,\'a0who makes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his\'a0own good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated return\'a0of the Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs most warmly.\'a0Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only man who never\'a0came back from Troy, but many another went down as well as he. Go, then,\'a0within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your\'a0distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for speech is man's matter,\'a0and mine above all others- for it is I who am master\'a0here."\
\
She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying\'a0in her heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she\'a0mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes. But\'a0the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters, and prayed\'a0each one that he might be her bed fellow.\
\
Then Telemachus spoke, "Shameless," he cried, "and insolent suitors,\'a0let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it\'a0is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has;\'a0but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal\'a0notice to depart, and feast at one another's houses, turn and turn about,\'a0at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in spunging\'a0upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full, and\'a0when you fall in my father's house there shall be no man to avenge\'a0you."\
\
The suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at\'a0the boldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, "The\'a0gods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may Jove\'a0never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before\'a0you."\
\
Telemachus answered, "Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god\'a0willing, I will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think\'a0of for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches\'a0and honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men in\'a0Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among them;\'a0nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom\'a0Ulysses has won for me."\
\
Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, "It rests with heaven\'a0to decide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your\'a0own house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man in\'a0Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow, I want\'a0to know about this stranger. What country does he come from? Of what family\'a0is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you news about the return\'a0of your father, or was he on business of his own? He seemed a well-to-do\'a0man, but he hurried off so suddenly that he was gone in a moment before\'a0we could get to know him."\
\
"My father is dead and gone," answered Telemachus, "and even if\'a0some rumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed\'a0sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophecyings\'a0no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus, chief of\'a0the Taphians, an old friend of my father's." But in his heart he knew that\'a0it had been the goddess.\
\
The suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the\'a0evening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed\'a0each in his own abode. Telemachus's room was high up in a tower that looked\'a0on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and full of thought.\'a0A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor, went before\'a0him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes had bought her with his own\'a0money when she was quite young; he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her,\'a0and shewed as much respect to her in his household as he did to his own\'a0wedded wife, but he did not take her to his bed for he feared his wife's\'a0resentment. She it was who now lighted Telemachus to his room, and she\'a0loved him better than any of the other women in the house did, for she\'a0had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened the door of his bed room and\'a0sat down upon the bed; as he took off his shirt he gave it to the good\'a0old woman, who folded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his\'a0bed side, after which she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch,\'a0and drew the bolt home by means of the strap. But Telemachus as he lay\'a0covered with a woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended\'a0voyage of the counsel that Minerva had given him.\
